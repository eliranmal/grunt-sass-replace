# grunt-sass-replace

> replaces sass values with grunt

[![NPM][16]][17]

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.5`

If you haven't used [Grunt][1] before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started][2] guide, as it explains 
how to create a [Gruntfile][3] as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, 
you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-sass-replace --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-sass-replace');
```

## The 'sass-replace' task

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `sass-replace` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  'sass-replace': {
    files: [
      {
        src: 'my-styles.scss',
        dest: 'my-new-styles.scss'
      }
    ],
    options: {
      variables: [
        {
          name: 'my-var',
          from: '10px',
          to: '3.333em'
        }
      ],
      imports: [
        {
          from: 'http://foo.wat.com',
          to: 'http://bar.wat.com'
        }
      ]
    }
  },
});
```

### Options

#### options.variables

_**Type:** `Array<Object>`_  
_**Default value:** none_  
_**Mandatory:** either this or [`options.imports`][4] must be set_  

A collection of [`VariableInstruction`][13]s to describe replacements of sass variable values.

##### VariableInstruction

_**Type:** `Object`_  
_**Default value:** none_  
_**Mandatory:** at least one `VariableInstruction` must be available on the [`options.variables`][8] collection_  

An object representing a single instruction in the `options.variables` collection.  
The [`to`][5] field is mandatory, and either [`from`][6], [`name`][7] or both can be used to filter the lookup.

When both `name` and `from` are used, they both apply as filters. As `name` can be passed as a string *or* as a regular 
expression, it presents two common use cases:

- passing both fields as strings can be used to replace values in duplicate variable declarations, e.g. a 
variable overriding a variable with the same name in another file.
- passing a string to `from` and a regular expression to `name` can be used to achieve finer filtering, matching
variables which have a certain value, by several names.

###### VariableInstruction.name

_**Type:** `String|RegExp`_  
_**Default value:** `/\S+/` (match at least one non-whitespace character)_  
_**Mandatory:** either this or the [`from`][6] field must be set_  

The variable name for lookup, without the leading `$`.
 
When a string is passed, the literal value is searched, e.g. `my-var` will match `$my-var: "foo"`.

A regular expression can be passed in its literal form or as a `RegExp` instance.  
e.g. `/my[-_]?[Vv]ar/` or `new RegExp('my[-_]?[Vv]ar')` will both match `$my-var: "foo"`, `$my_var: "foo"` and `$myVar: "foo"`.

When using a `RegExp` instance, only its source is used for the lookup (flags are ignored).

###### VariableInstruction.from

_**Type:** `String|Number|Boolean`_  
_**Default value:** none_  
_**Mandatory:** either this or the [`name`][7] field must be set_  

The variable's current value for lookup. Note that `!default` statements are not captured for replacement, and are 
kept as is ([post an issue][12] if you want to be able to alter `!default` statements as well).

See [note on using double quotes when replacing string values][9].

###### VariableInstruction.to

_**Type:** `String|Number|Boolean`_  
_**Default value:** none_  
_**Mandatory:** yes_  

A new value for the matched variable.

See [note on using double quotes when replacing string values][9].


##### Note on replacing string values

When replacing variable values of type string, e.g. `$my-var: "foo"` &rarr; `$my-var: "bar"`, the variable value's 
surrounding double quotes may be omitted from the `from`/`to` field's value, as they will be captured and passed on to 
the replacement.  
However, it is advised to prefer the explicit notation and always surround string values with double quotes, for better 
readability and to avoid confusion or unexpected behavior.

:+1:  
```javascript
  {
    from: '"foo"',
    to: '"bar"'
  }
  ...
```

:-1:  
```javascript
  {
    from: 'foo',
    to: 'bar'
  }
  ...
```


#### options.imports

_**Type:** `Array<Object>`_  
_**Default value:** none_  
_**Mandatory:** either this or [`options.variables`][8] must be set_  

A collection of [`ImportInstruction`][14]s to describe replacements of `@import` paths.

##### ImportInstruction

_**Type:** `Object`_  
_**Default value:** none_  
_**Mandatory:** at least one `ImportInstruction` must be available on the [`options.imports`][4] collection_  

An object representing a single instruction in the `options.imports` collection.  
Both [`from`][10] and [`to`][11] fields are mandatory.

###### ImportInstruction.from

_**Type:** `String`_  
_**Default value:** none_  
_**Mandatory:** yes_  

The import path(s) current value for lookup. Captures only the path contents, i.e. everything between the surrounding 
quotes, or inside a `url()`.

Capturing of everything after the `@import` (including quotes or `url()`s) is currently not supported, 
[post an issue][12] if you find it useful. Also, passing regular expressions was not tested, but probably works.

###### ImportInstruction.to

_**Type:** `String`_  
_**Default value:** none_  
_**Mandatory:** yes_  

A new value for the matched import path(s).


### Usage Examples

#### Replacing variables by current value

This example also shows the usage of various types in variable values.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  'sass-replace': {
    files: {
     'dest/my-styles.scss': 'src/my-styles.scss'
    },
    options: {
      variables: [
        {
          from: '"foo"',
          to: '"bar"'
        },
        {
          from: 10,
          to: '10%'
        },
        {
          from: 3.333,
          to: 6.666
        },
        {
          from: '10px',
          to: '20em'
        }
      ]
    }
  }
});
```

#### Replacing variables by name

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  'sass-replace': {
    files: {
      'dest/my-styles.scss': 'src/my-styles.scss'
    },
    options: {
      variables: [
        {
          name: 'my-var',
          to: 'bar'
        }
      ]
    }
  }
});
```

#### Replacing variables by name and current value

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  'sass-replace': {
    files: {
      'dest/my-styles.scss': 'src/my-styles.scss'
    },
    options: {
      variables: [
        {
          name: 'my-var',
          from: '"foo"',
          to: '"bar"'
        }
      ]
    }
  }
});
```

#### Replacing variables using regular expressions

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  'sass-replace': {
    files: {
      'dest/my-styles.scss': 'src/my-styles.scss'
    },
    options: {
      variables: [
        {
          name: new RegExp('my[-_]?[Vv]ar'),
          from: '"foo"',
          to: 1000000000000
        },
        {
          name: /my[-_]?[Nn]um[-_]?[Vv]ar/,
          to: -1
        }
      ]
    }
  }
});
```

#### Replacing imports

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  'sass-replace': {
    files: {
      'dest/my-styles.scss': 'src/my-styles.scss'
    },
    options: {
      imports: [
        {
          from: 'foo',
          to: 'bar'
        },
        {
          from: 'foo.css',
          to: 'bar.css'
        },
        {
          from: 'foo.scss',
          to: 'bar.scss'
        },
        {
          from: 'http://wat.com/foo',
          to: 'http://wat.com/bar'
        },
        {
          from: 'http://wat.tha.fuck.com/foo',
          to: 'http://wat.tha.fuck.com/bar'
        },
        {
          from: 'http://wat.com/foo?family=#{$family}',
          to: 'http://wat.com/bar?family=#{$family}'
        },
        {
          from: 'foo-foo',
          to: 'bar-bar'
        },
        {
          from: 'foo-foo-foo',
          to: 'bar-bar-bar'
        }
      ]
    }
  }
});
```

## Contributing
